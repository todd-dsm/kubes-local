# kubes-local

A QnD (Quick and Dirty) Test Environment

## Assumptions

Before digging in, some assumptions have been made:

* macOS Platform
* these programs have been installed
  * `make`, more to be named later
  * `minikube` and `docker desktop` (must be running)
    * both configured with at 8GB of Memory
* AuthN/Z are important but not relevant to this demo

## Quickstart

1. Issue one command to bootstrap everything: `make all`
